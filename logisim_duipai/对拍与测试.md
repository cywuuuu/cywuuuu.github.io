##### 建立 测试.circ

For our example, we'll suppose we've built the below circuit in a file named `adder-test.circ`. It uses a two-bit adder as a subcircuit and iterates using a counter through all 16 possible inputs to it.

After this circuit has been built, we then execute Logisim from the command line, providing the filename of the project and the -tty option with the table parameter.

> ```
> java -jar logisim-filename.jar adder-test.circ -tty table
> ```

Without bringing up any windows, Logisim loads the circuit and begins to execute it, ticking any clocks as fast as it can while completing the propagation between each tick. After each propagation is completed, Logisim loads the current values of the output pins; if any have changed from the previous propagation, then all values are displayed in tab-delimited format. If there is an output pin labeled with the special word halt, its output is not displayed — but once the pin's value reaches 1 after a propagation is completed, Logisim ends the simulation.jav

For our example, Logisim displays the table below. Because we have two output pins corresponding to the two inputs a and b into the two-bit adder, these outputs are included as the first two columns of the output. And there is another output pin corresponding to the two-bit adder's output, so it is the third column. The columns are ordered left-to-right according to the top-down ordering within the circuit.

# Testing multiple files

In the classroom example, you will have many files that you wish to test for their equivalence, and you won't want to read the output for each of the student's solutions.

## Building comparison into the circuit

One approach is to build a test circuit that does the comparison directly. Here, we create an additional circuit within the testing file that contains our solution circuit. In our overall testing circuit, we include both the subcircuit from `adder-master.circ` and the subcircuit from the solution circuit located directly into the nested circuit. We wire it so that there is just one output, which is 1 as long as the two subcircuits agree.

Now we can simply run Logisim substituting each query file. For any correct solution, the only output will be 1.

## Using redirection and shell scripts

If you're quite comfortable with the command line, you can build your own shell script to accomplish this. Here, we'll use redirection (the > operator) to save the output of each circuit into a file. For instance, we might issue the following two commands to collect the output of the master circuit and the query circuit.

> ```
> java -jar logisim.jar test_sample.circ -tty table > output_sample.txt
> 
> java -jar logisim.jar test.circ -tty table > output.txt
> 
> fc output_sample.txt output.txt
> ```

Now we've created two different files. We can then compare the two output files using a program built for that purpose. Under Linux or MacOS X, you might want to use the *cmp* or *diff* command-line utilities. Under Windows, you might want to use WinMerge.
